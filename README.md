 COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

 
 Project Description

 
The COVID-19 Global Data Tracker is a data analysis and reporting project designed to monitor and visualize global trends related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The project focuses on analyzing metrics such as cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccinations across countries and over time.

Using Python’s data science stack, learners will clean and process real-world datasets, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), create compelling visualizations, and summarize their findings through narrative insights. The final product is a professional-grade notebook suitable for presentation or publishing.


 Objectives

 
Import and clean COVID-19 global data

Analyze time trends: cases, deaths, and vaccinations

Compare metrics across countries or regions

Visualize trends using charts and maps

Communicate findings clearly in a Jupyter Notebook or report


Tools and Libraries Used


Jupyter Notebook

pandas

matplotlib

seaborn

Optional:

plotly.express (for choropleth maps)

geopandas (for advanced geographic visualizations)


How to Run the Project


Install Jupyter Notebook or open it via Anaconda or VS Code.

Place the dataset (e.g., owid-covid-data.csv) in the working directory.

Open week8.ipynb in Jupyter.

Run each cell in sequence to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.

(Optional) Export the notebook as a PDF or slide deck.


Insights & Reflections


Bar graphs offered clearer comparisons for discrete country-level data than line plots in some contexts.

Line plots effectively captured time-based trends in cases, deaths, and vaccinations.

Including labels and legends greatly improved the clarity of the visualizations.

Visual storytelling through plots helped me uncover patterns I might have missed in raw data.

This project strengthened my understanding of data cleaning, exploration, and communication—key steps in real-world data science workflows.
